    "\n",
    "Pandas is a Python library used for data analysis and manipulation. Within the world of data science, it is a ubiquitous and widely used library. If you are learning how to analyze data in Python, it will be almost impossible to avoid pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this workshop, we will be using two types of data structues - NumPy arrays and pandas DataFrames. Pandas dataframes are specifically for data which is two dimensional (rows and columns). NumPy arrays, while similar in some ways, are meant to work with higher dimensional data. We’ll see this in a future lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is very powerful. In this session, we’ll be learning how to access information in pandas dataframes and how to do some basic manipulation and analysis. The first step in using pandas is importing it. Typically when pandas is imported, it is shortened to pd."
